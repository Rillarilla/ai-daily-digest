Article Content:
Americans have started bringing artificial intelligence into their daily work routines at speeds that caught many by surprise, new polling data shows.

A fresh Gallup Workforce survey reveals that 12% of working adults now turn to AI every single day on the job. The research, which questioned more than 22,000 employed Americans this fall, shows how quickly these tools have spread through offices and workplaces nationwide.

Around one in four workers tap into AI at least several times each week, the survey found. Close to half reported using these technologies at least a handful of times annually. That marks a big jump from 2023, when just 21% said they used AI even occasionally. The shift comes after ChatGPT kicked off a massive surge in AI tools that can handle tasks like drafting emails, writing code, boiling down lengthy reports, making images, and fielding questions.

Gene Walinski, who works at a Home Depot in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, represents this new wave of AI users. The 70-year-old pulls out his phone about once every hour during his shift to ask an AI assistant about products in the electrical department when he runs into items he doesn’t know inside and out.

“I think my job would suffer if I couldn’t because there would be a lot of shrugged shoulders and ‘I don’t know’ and customers don’t want to hear that,” Walinski explained.

Around 6 out of every 10 people in tech jobs use AI several times weekly, with roughly 3 in 10 using it daily. The numbers show a big increase since 2023, though signs point to growth possibly leveling off after the sharp spike between 2024 and 2025.

Finance workers have also jumped on board. Andrea Tanzi, a 28-year-old investment banker at Bank of America in New York, uses AI daily to process documents and data that would otherwise eat up hours of his time. He also relies on the bank’s internal AI assistant, Erica, for routine administrative work.

Most people working in professional services, colleges and universities, or elementary and high school education now use AI at least occasionally throughout the year.

Joyce Hatzidakis, a 60-year-old high school art teacher in Riverside, California, began testing AI chatbots to polish up messages she sends to parents.

“I can scribble out a note and not worry about what I say and then tell it what tone I want,” she said. “And then, when I reread it, if it’s not quite right, I can have it edited again. I’m definitely getting less parent complaints.”

Another Gallup survey from last year found that about 6 in 10 workplace AI users depend on chatbots or virtual helpers. Around 4 in 10 tap AI to pull together information, spark ideas, or pick up new skills.

Hatzidakis started with ChatGPT before moving to Google’s Gemini when her school district chose it as the official platform. She’s even used it for writing recommendation letters, noting “there’s only so many ways to say a kid is really creative.”

Both the AI business world and the U.S. government keep pushing for more AI use in workplaces and schools. Companies need more buyers to make sense of the enormous sums poured into building and running power-hungry AI systems. But experts disagree on whether these tools will actually lift productivity or hurt job prospects.

“Most of the workers that are most highly exposed to AI, who are most likely to have it disrupt their workflows, for good or for bad, have these characteristics that make them pretty adaptable,” said Sam Manning, a fellow at the Centre for the Governance of AI.

Manning noted these computer-based workers usually have more education, broader skill sets, and bigger savings to help them weather job loss.

However, Manning’s research identified about 6.1 million American workers who face heavy AI exposure but lack the tools to adapt easily. Many handle administrative and clerical duties, roughly 86% are women, and they tend to be older and live in smaller cities like college towns or state capitals with fewer career options.

“If their skills are automated, they have less transferable skills to other jobs and they have a lower savings, if any savings,” Manning said.

A separate 2025 Gallup survey found that few employees think new technology, automation, robots, or AI will likely wipe out their jobs within five years. Half said it’s not at all likely, down slightly from about 6 in 10 in 2023.

Rev. Michael Bingham, pastor at Faith Community Methodist Church in Jacksonville, Florida, isn’t worried. A chatbot gave him nonsense when he asked about medieval theologian Anselm of Canterbury, and he said he’d never ask a “soulless” machine to help write sermons.

WAF against AI-driven crawlers and scrapers. Piss bloody bots off famously

A web firewall (WAF) that both scares away and lures those pesky LLM/AI scraper bots. It hits an incoming HTTP request with a quick check — "Are you human, or just another bloody AI scraper in a trench coat?"— before letting it in.

Being customizable, Fantasma Cero  supports and employs some of the features:

Experts say tool can give ‘completely wrong’ medical advice which could put users at risk of serious harm

AI Overviews cite YouTube more than any medical site, study suggests

Do I have the flu or Covid? Why do I wake up feeling tired? What is causing the pain in my chest? For more than two decades, typing medical questions into the world’s most popular search engine has served up a list of links to websites with the answers. Google those health queries today and the response will likely be written by artificial intelligence.

Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, first set out the company’s plans to enmesh AI into its search engine at its annual conference in Mountain View, California, in May 2024. Starting that month, he said, US users would see a new feature, AI Overviews, which would provide information summaries above traditional search results. The change marked the biggest shake-up of Google’s core product in a quarter of a century. By July 2025, the technology had expanded to more than 200 countries in 40 languages, with 2 billion people served AI Overviews each month.

With the rapid rollout of AI Overviews, Google is racing to protect its traditional search business, which generates about $200bn (£147bn) a year, before upstart AI rivals can derail it. “We are leading at the frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace,” Pichai said last July. AI Overviews in particular were “performing well”, he added.

But overviews carry risks, experts say. They use generative AI to provide snapshots of information about a topic or question, adding conversational answers above the traditional search results in the blink of an eye. They can cite sources, but do not necessarily know when that source is incorrect.

Within weeks of the feature launching in the US, users encountered untruths across a range of subjects. One AI Overview said Andrew Jackson, the seventh US president, graduated from college in 2005. Elizabeth Reid, Google’s head of search, responded to criticism in a blog post. She conceded that “in a small number of cases”, AI Overviews had misinterpreted language on web pages and presented inaccurate information. “At the scale of the web, with billions of queries coming in every day, there are bound to be some oddities and errors,” she wrote.

But when those questions are about health, accuracy and context are essential and non-negotiable, experts say. Google is facing mounting scrutiny of its AI Overviews for medical queries after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information.

The company says AI Overviews are “reliable”. But the Guardian found some medical summaries served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm. In one case, which experts said was “really dangerous”, Google wrongly advised people with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods. Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.

In another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people who had serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. What AI Overviews said was normal could vary drastically from what was actually considered normal, experts said. The summaries could lead to seriously ill patients wrongly thinking they had a normal test result and not bothering to attend follow-up appointments.

AI Overviews about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.

Google initially sought to downplay the Guardian’s findings. From what its own clinicians could assess, the company said, the AI Overviews that alarmed experts linked to reputable sources and recommended seeking expert advice. “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information,” a spokesperson said.

Within days, however, the company removed some of the AI Overviews for health queries flagged by the Guardian. “We do not comment on individual removals within search,” a spokesperson said. “In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.”

While experts welcomed the removal of some AI summaries for health queries, many remain worried. “Our bigger concern with all this is that it is nit-picking a single search result and Google can just shut off the AI Overviews for that but it’s not tackling the bigger issue of AI Overviews for health,” says Vanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, a liver health charity.

“There are still too many examples out there of Google AI Overviews giving people inaccurate health information,” adds Sue Farrington, the chair of the Patient Information Forum, which prom</p>

Article Content:
feature Bernard Lambeau, a Belgium-based software developer and founder of several technology companies, created a programming language called Elo with the help of Anthropic's Claude Code.

Starting on December 25, 2025, he published a series of posts about the project. The first post names Claude as a co-author.

"In roughly 24 hours of collaboration, we built a complete expression language with a parser, type system, three compilers, a standard library, a CLI tool, and a documentation website. Not bad for a day's work,” Lambeau and Claude wrote.

"Elo isn't just a demonstration that AI can write code. It's a demonstration that humans and AI can build together – each contributing what they do best,” they added.

As an expression language that compiles to JavaScript, Ruby, and SQL, Elo is intended as a portable way to handle form validation, e-commerce order processing, and subscription logic.

Lambeau, founder and CTO of Klaro Cards and CEO of app consultancy Enspirit, is not the first to develop a programming language with the help of AI.

Steve Klabnik performed a similar feat last year with the Rue programming language. In September 2025, Geoffrey Huntley enlisted Claude to write a programming language called Cursed. And before that, Avital Tamir published a Claude-authored repo for the Server programming language, with the caveat that the code is not intended for actual use.

Claude Code isn't the only AI-assisted programming method having a moment. AI biz Cursor created a rudimentary browser using OpenAI's GPT-5.2. And developer Ola Prøis used Cursor, powered by Claude, to create a Rust-based text editor called Ferrite.

Claude users generally acknowledge that their pair partner makes mistakes. But those committed to AI assistance find it worthwhile to clean up after their helper.

"Claude Code knows almost every tech stack (and can search the web), knows the Linux commands that matter (search code, search & replace, compile, test, etc.), and does that 10x faster than I can do myself," Lambeau told The Register in an email interview.

Claude, he said, allows him to use technology he hasn't mastered.

"I was already a full-stack developer (on languages, frameworks & reusable libraries I knew); I'm now a full-stack++ dev because I can also use languages, frameworks, and reusable libraries I barely know, if at all," he explained.

"Claude Code falls short if you don't have a great methodology. It needs feedback loops to work fine; otherwise, it derails. One possible feedback loop is a human reviewing code and testing manually. But there's a better/complementary approach if you want it to work autonomously. On both Elo and Bmg.js, I've started by making sure the testing methodology was effective and scientifically sound. Claude writes the tests, executes them, discovers where it's wrong, and corrects itself. Impressive."

Lambeau said he still needs to review some of Claude's output.

"But if I read the tests, agree with them, and can check myself that they run fine, I'm 95 percent sure it's already correct as a black box (not even reading the code)," he explained. "Then I can check the architecture and code quality as a white box by having a general look at the code, but I don't have to understand every detail."

Notably, Lambeau documented the series of prompts he used to create the language. The repo includes more than 100 tasks used to direct the AI model. In addition, Lambeau has published a video that describes his AI pair programming process.

"I started in a setting where Claude Code asked for permissions every 20 seconds and I was checking everything it did," Lambeau explained. "After a few successes, I quickly set up safe environments to be able to let Claude Code run in full autonomy (isolated computer & isolated Linux user, or running in a Docker image)."

Lambeau said he still uses plan mode for complex tasks that require conversation with Claude.

"I review the plan, make sure we have a test strategy that's sound, then switch Claude to autonomous mode and look at the tests, code & results afterward," he said. "That's very similar to a lead-dev/CTO + QA role, btw; it's just much faster than with human devs."

Lambeau, who has a PhD in software engineering and 30 years of experience as a developer, said both experts and novices can benefit from Claude Code, though he added that a service like Lovable might be more approachable for those not already acclimated to the command line.

"Now, when it comes to real software/product engineering, I think Claude Code requires experts (so far)," he said. "You still need to guide it a lot to keep the quality high enough. You need very strong expertise to do it effectively. Currently (Claude will still improve a lot), if you don't have the expertise, you certainly end up with a big mess of unmaintainable code."

Many developers have said as much about AI tools. They're more useful as an amplifier of expertise than as a replacement for it. The situation is </p>

Synchronous webhook tools block assistant responses while waiting on external systems. This works for fast APIs, but breaks down when requests take longer than a few seconds. AI Assistants now support async webhook tools paired with live message injection, so long-running tasks can complete without interrupting the conversation.

Your own personal AI assistant. Any OS. Any Platform. The lobster way. 🦞

Clawdbot is a personal AI assistant you run on your own devices.
It answers you on the channels you already use (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, WebChat), plus extension channels like BlueBubbles, Matrix, Zalo, and Zalo Personal. It can speak and listen on macOS/iOS/Android, and can render a live Canvas you control. The Gateway is just the control plane — the product is the assistant.

If you want a personal, single-user assistant that feels local, fast, and always-on, this is it.

Website · Docs · Getting Started · Updating · Showcase · FAQ · Wizard · Nix · Docker · Discord

Preferred setup: run the onboarding wizard (clawdbot onboard). It walks through gateway, workspace, channels, and skills. The CLI wizard is the recommended path and works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL2; strongly recommended).
Works with npm, pnpm, or bun.
New install? Start here: Getting started

Model note: while any model is supported, I strongly recommend Anthropic Pro/Max (100/200) + Opus 4.5 for long‑context strength and better prompt‑injection resistance. See Onboarding.

The wizard installs the Gateway daemon (launchd/systemd user service) so it stays running.

Full beginner guide (auth, pairing, channels): Getting started

Upgrading? Updating guide (and run clawdbot doctor).

Switch channels (git + npm): clawdbot update --channel stable|beta|dev.
Details: Development channels.

Prefer pnpm for builds from source. Bun is optional for running TypeScript directly.

Note: pnpm clawdbot ... runs TypeScript directly (via tsx). pnpm build produces dist/ for running via Node / the packaged clawdbot binary.

Clawdbot connects to real messaging surfaces. Treat inbound DMs as untrusted input.

Default behavior on Telegram/WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage/Microsoft Teams/Discord/Google Chat/Slack:

Run clawdbot doctor to surface risky/misconfigured DM policies.

Clawdbot can auto-configure Tailscale Serve (tailnet-only) or Funnel (public) while the Gateway stays bound to loopback. Configure gateway.tailscale.mode:

It’s perfectly fine to run the Gateway on a small Linux instance. Clients (macOS app, CLI, WebChat) can connect over Tailscale Serve/Funnel or SSH tunnels, and you can still pair device nodes (macOS/iOS/Android) to execute device‑local actions when needed.

The macOS app can run in node mode and advertises its capabilities + permission map over the Gateway WebSocket (node.list / node.describe). Clients can then execute local actions via node.invoke:

Elevated bash (host permissions) is separate from macOS TCC:

ClawdHub is a minimal skill registry. With ClawdHub enabled, the agent can search for skills automatically and pull in new ones as needed.

Send these in WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack/Google Chat/Microsoft Teams/WebChat (group commands are owner-only):

The Gateway alone delivers a great experience. All apps are optional and add extra features.

If you plan to build/run companion apps, follow the platform runbooks below.

Note: signed builds required for macOS permissions to stick across rebuilds (see docs/mac/permissions.md).

Minimal ~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json (model + defaults):

Full configuration reference (all keys + examples).

Details: Security guide · Docker + sandboxing · Sandbox config

Use these when you’re past the onboarding flow and want the deeper reference.

永辉学习胖东来后仍每天亏600万，亏损幅度进一步扩大
1月20日，永辉超市(601933.SH)发布了2025年度业绩预告，预计归属于上市公司股东的净利润为-21.4亿元，上年同期为-14.7亿元。换算下来，过去一年里，这家全国知名的连锁超市几乎每天一开门，就要烧掉将近600万元。这已是永辉连续第五年亏损。2021年至2025年，永辉分别亏损39.44亿元、27.63亿元、13.29亿元、14.65亿元和21.4亿元，累计亏损金额超过116亿元。
事实上，下行并非突然发生。早在2018年前后，永辉的毛利率就开始逐年走低。为了自救，永辉曾先后尝试多条路径：推出“超级物种”探索生鲜加餐饮，布局永辉MINI社区小店，试水仓储店和数字化转型，但这些调整都未能扭转整体颓势，反而不断消耗资源与耐心。
2024年5月，在与永辉管理层深度交流后，胖东来正式启动对永辉的帮扶计划。于东来先后在郑州考察多家永辉门店，从商品结构、卖场设计、服务细节等方面提出调整思路。“学习胖东来”随即被抬升为永辉的核心战略。消息公布后，永辉股价连续三个交易日上涨，累计涨幅超过20%，市场对这场转型寄予厚望。
然而，20个月过去，期待并未兑现。最新业绩预告显示，永辉不仅未能止住亏损，亏损幅度反而进一步扩大。公司将预亏原因归结为三方面：门店调整带来的阶段性成本压力、供应链改革投入，以及对外投资和资产减值。（南风窗）
